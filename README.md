# HillPattern First assignment
# Introduction

This program allows the user to input the number of shapes and the type of shape they want to be displayed. The program will then generate the desired shapes.

# Requirements

    Python 3 or higher

# Usage

    Run the program in your terminal or command prompt.
    Enter the number of shapes you want to be displayed.
    Enter the type of shape you want to be displayed.
    The program will generate the desired shapes.

# Program Explanation

    The user is prompted to enter the number of shapes they want to be displayed.
    The user is then prompted to enter the type of shape they want to be displayed.
    The program then uses nested for loops to generate the desired shapes.
    The inner loops create spaces and add the inputted shape.
    The program then moves to the next line and repeats the process until the desired number of shapes have been displayed.

# Conclusion

This program provides an easy and efficient way to generate different shapes based on the user's input. The program uses nested loops to create the desired shapes and is an excellent tool for learning and practicing loop structures in Python.




# Word Reversal Second Assignment 

* This code prompts the user to enter a phrase or sentence, reverses each word in the phrase, and then concatenates the reversed words into a single string.
# Usage

To run this code, simply run the file in a Python environment. The user will be prompted to enter a phrase or sentence, and the reversed phrase will be outputted to the console.
# Code Walkthrough

    The user is prompted to enter a phrase or sentence using the line user_data = input("Enter a phrase or sentence: ").

    The code initializes a variable word_start to keep track of the starting index of each word in the input string.

    The input string is stored as a list of words using a loop that iterates through each character in the string and splits the string into words whenever a space is encountered.

    The code initializes a list rev_words to store the reversed words.

    The code then loops through each word in the list, reverses the word by looping through each letter in the word in reverse order, and stores the reversed word in the rev_words list.

    The reversed words are then concatenated into a single string using a loop that iterates through each word in the rev_words list.

    The concatenated string is then printed to the console using the line print(concatenated).
